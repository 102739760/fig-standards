members.

        member application procedure described in this bylaw.

</dl>

Membership List
---------------

The current Member Projects in PHP-FIG will be listed at the following URL:
http://www.php-fig.org/

The list may also indicate the names of the current Voting Representative for
each Member Project. This list must be updated for any change in the composition
of Member Projects or Voting Representatives.

Membership Application
----------------------

To cast votes on PHP-FIG proposals, it is required that a PHP project apply to
become a Member Project. This application may be submitted by any individual who
is authorised by the PHP project in question to do so.

The application must be emailed to the main [php-fig mailing list][list] and
is restricted to one application per email.

The subject of the email must follow the following format:

    Membership Request: {$your_name} ({$project_name})

The body of the email should provide details of the PHP project applying for
membership including its name, URL, the name of the designated Voting
Representative and any other details that the individual applying
on behalf of the PHP project believes are necessary to include.

The membership application will be voted upon by the existing Member Projects
in accordance with the [Voting Protocol bylaw][voting].

There are no restrictions on the number of times a PHP project may apply to
become a Member Project.

Voting Representatives
-----------------------

The votes of all Member Projects are cast by Voting Representives who have been
authorised to do so by the Member Project. Each Voting Representative is chosen
solely by a Member Project and their selection is not subject to the approval
of PHP-FIG.

To prevent illegal or erroneous voting, the Voting Representative must be
confirmed by the Member Project to be authorised to act in such a capacity
by sending an email to the the main [php-fig mailing list][list] where
practical and where this does not conflict with the Member Project's policies.
The other Member Projects may seek confirmation through other channels as
necessary to prevent fraudulent vote casting.

A Member Project may not have more than one Voting Representative at a time.

A Voting Representative may temporarily confer their voting rights onto another
individual who is authorised by the Member Project which they represent. This
conferral must be notified to PHP-FIG by the current Voting Representative
by sending an email to the the main [php-fig mailing list][list]. This email
must state the name of the temporary Voting Representative and the period of
time for which their temporary voting rights will remain valid. All voting
rights will automatically return to the original Voting Representative at the
end of the period of time stated in this email. All dates noted should reference
a timezone. Where a timezone is not referenced, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
will be assumed.

Resignation Of Member Projects
------------------------------

A Member Project may resign from PHP-FIG in writing to the main
[php-fig mailing list][list] or by stating their intention to do so on another
official public channel. Once such a statement is published, a PHP project
immediately ceases to be a Member Project.

A former Member Project may reapply for membership at any future date.
