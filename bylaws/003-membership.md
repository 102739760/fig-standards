defines the rules and rights of all members.

</dl>

Membership List
---------------

The current Voting Members in PHP-FIG will be listed at the following URL:
http://www.php-fig.org/

The list may also indicate the names of the current Project Representative for
each Voting Member. This list must be updated for any change in the composition
of Voting Members or Project Representatives.

Membership Application
----------------------

### Non-Voting Community Members

Non-Voting Community Members are not required to apply for membership. The only
action required is to join an officially supported mailing list.

### Voting Members

To cast votes on PHP-FIG proposals, it is required that a PHP project apply to
become a Voting Member. This application may be submitted by any individual who
is authorised by the PHP project in question to do so.

The application must be emailed to the main [php-fig mailing list][list] and
is restricted to one application per email.

    [list]: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/php-fig

The subject of the email must follow the following format:

    Membership Request: {$your_name} ({$project_name})

The body of the email should provide details of the PHP project applying for
membership including its name, URL and any other details the individual applying
on behalf of the PHP project believes necessary.

The membership application will be voted upon by the existing Voting Members
in accordance with the [Voting Protocol bylaw][voting].

    [voting]: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/bylaws/001-voting-protocol.md

There are no restrictions on the number of times a PHP project may apply to
become a Voting Member.

Project Representatives
-----------------------

The votes of all Voting Members are cast by Project Representives who have been
authorised to do so by the Voting Member. The Project Representative is chosen
solely by the Voting Member and their selection is not subject to the approval
of PHP-FIG.

To prevent illegal or erroneous voting, the Project Representative must be
confirmed by the Voting Member to be authorised to act in such a capacity
in an email to the the main [php-fig mailing list][list] where
practical and where this does not conflict with the Voting Member's policies.
The other Voting Members may seek confirmation through other channels as
necessary.

    [list]: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/php-fig

A Voting Member may have more than one Project Representative with the
understanding that this does not confer additional votes and that any conflicts
in casted votes must be reconciled by the Voting Member prior to their vote
being officially recognised.

Resignation Of Voting Members
-----------------------------

A Voting Member may resign from PHP-FIG in writing to the main
[php-fig mailing list][list] or by stating their intention to do so on another
official public channel. Once such a statement is published, a PHP project
immediately ceases to be a Voting Member.

A former Voting Member may reapply for membership at any future date.
